# Architecture and Design Guidelines

## System Design Principles
- Design for modularity and reusability
- Create clear boundaries between components
- Define interfaces before implementation
- Use dependency injection for flexibility
- Follow domain-driven design principles where appropriate

## Component Design
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Design for testability
- Minimize coupling between components
- Use composition patterns effectively
- Document component responsibilities clearly

## API Design
- Design consistent and intuitive APIs
- Use RESTful principles for web APIs
- Version APIs appropriately
- Document all public interfaces
- Consider backward compatibility

## Data Architecture
- Design efficient data models
- Normalize data appropriately
- Consider caching strategies
- Plan for data growth and scaling
- Implement proper data validation

## Security Architecture
- Apply security by design principles
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regular security reviews and updates
