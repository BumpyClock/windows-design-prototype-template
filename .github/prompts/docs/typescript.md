## TypeScript

- I prefer to use pnpm for everything (pnpm add, pnpm run, etc)
- Do not use old fashioned methods for package management like npm or yarn.
- Make sure that there is a package.json file in the root directory.
- If there isn't a package.json file, create one using pnpm by running pnpm init.
