## Source Control

- use git for version control.
- use the Github CLI (`gh`) for all Git operations.
- only fallback to `git` commands when `gh` is not available or when the user explicitly instructs you to do so.
- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive.
- Commit messages should follow the conventional commit format.
- Commit messages should be written in the imperative mood.
- Commit messages should be written in the present tense.
