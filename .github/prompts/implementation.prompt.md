# Implementation Guidelines

## Planning Phase
- Break down features into manageable tasks
- Identify dependencies and blockers
- Plan for incremental delivery
- Consider performance requirements
- Design for extensibility

## Implementation Strategy
- Start with the most critical functionality
- Build incrementally with working code
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Keep commits small and focused
- Regular integration with main branch

## Code Structure
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Create reusable components and utilities
- Implement proper error handling
- Add appropriate logging
- Consider internationalization needs

## Quality Assurance
- Write unit tests as you code
- Implement integration tests
- Perform manual testing
- Code review with peers
- Monitor performance metrics

## Documentation
- Document new APIs and interfaces
- Update user documentation
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Create examples and tutorials
- Update changelog and release notes
